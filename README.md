Simple Blink LED's
- This program simply blinks LED's
- Connections for this circuit include : 
  - Connect the Digital pins on the Arduino to the LED. 
  - On the MEGA 2560, D0 is Rx0 and D1 is Tx0. You will need to use D2 onwards.
  - A sample connection would include - D2 to Anode (Longer leg), 50 Ohm Resistor in line with Anode.
  - Cathode (Shorter leg) connects to the ground rail on the Breadboard.
  - You can use a Male to Male cable to connect the Arduino Ground, to the Ground rail on the Breadboard. 
  - Connect up as many LED's you want to connect. Use different colors. 
- Hardware required includes : 
  - Arduino MEGA 2560 R3 (You can choose your own version of the Arduino)
  - Coloured LED's 
  - Breadboard for building the circuit
  - Dupont Male to Male wires 
  - 50 Ohm Resistors 
- Software required includes : 
  - Arduino Development IDE
