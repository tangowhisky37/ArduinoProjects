Simple Blink LED's
- This program simply blinks LED's
- Connections for this circuit include - 
-- Connect the Digital pins on the Arduino to the LED. 
-- On the MEGA 2560, D0 is Rx0 and D1 is Tx0. You will need to use D2 onwards.
-- A sample connection would include - D2 to Anode (Longer leg), 50 Ohm Resistor in line with Anode.
-- Cathode (Shorter leg) connects to the ground rail on the Breadboard.
-- You can use a Male to Male cable to connect the Arduino Ground, to the Ground rail on the Breadboard. 
-- Connect up as many LED's you want to connect. Use different colors. 
-- Hardware required includes - 
--- Arduino MEGA 2560 R3 (You can choose your own version of the Arduino)
--- Coloured LED's 
--- Breadboard for building the circuit
--- Dupont Male to Male wires 
--- 50 Ohm Resistors 
-- Software required includes - 
--- Arduino Development IDE
