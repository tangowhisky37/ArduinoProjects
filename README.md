- This board is affordable, connects to a USB port of your machine, is breadboard friendly and most importantly works with the Arduino IDE.
- This is the Hello world of embedded electronics. You usually use this when you get started with any new board.
- This simple tutorial includes connecting the NodeMCU board to your machine, setting up the Arduino IDE interface and flashing the board.
- The sketch involved causes the light on the NodeMCU board to blink.
- Connections for this circuit include - 
 - Connecting the NodeMCU board to the USB port of your development machine
- Software required includes - 
 - Arduino IDE
 - ESP8266 libraries packes into the Arduino IDE which include the packages for NodeMCU board
 - Here are some of the links you might want to refer to with regards to configuring the Arduino IDE for ESP8266 development :

NodeMCU - Identify MAC Addres, Connect to a wireless network and blinks lights(Source code at https://github.com/tangowhisky37/ArduinoProjects/tree/master/Nodemcu_Geekcreit/ObtainMACAddress/Get_MAC_Address_v0.11)
- The NodeMCU board is one among the many ESP8266 boards out there but with a bit of a difference.
- This board is affordable, connects to a USB port of your machine, is breadboard friendly and most importantly works with the Arduino IDE.
- When working with NodeMCU boards one of the initial challenges is configuring your wireless router to allow the NodeMCU board to speak to it.
- Most routers (including mine at home) use whitelisting or a MAC address list to allow a set of endpoints to connect to it. This is more for purposes of security than anything else. 
- If this is the case with you as well, you will need to know the MAC address of the NodeMCU board to be able to configure the Wireless AP (Access Point) to allow your NodeMCU board to connect to it.
- Usually this is something you would only do once when you get started with any new NodeMCU board. This simple tutorial includes connecting the NodeMCU board to your machine, setting up the Arduino IDE interface and flashing the board with the code provided.
- Once you've flashed the board, open up the Serial monitor window in your Arduino IDE. Hit the re-set button on the NodeMCU to get the board to reboot.
- With the board booting up you should now see the MAC address for your new NodeMCU board on the Arduino IDE serial monitor. 
- Now's the opportunity to add the MAC address for the new NodeMCU board onto the whitelist of your wireless router. Once you've done that go back to your NodeMCU.
- Reset the board using the re-set button on the NodeMCU with the Arduino Serial Monitor open. You should now see the NodeMCU obtaining a DHCP lease from your wireless router. 
- The sketch involved causes the light on the NodeMCU board to blink.
- Connections for this circuit include -
 - Connecting the NodeMCU board to the USB port of your development machine
 - Software required includes -
  - Arduino IDE

IoT (Internet Of Things) Soil Moisture Sensor that Tweets using NodeMCU with ESP8266 v1 (https://github.com/tangowhisky37/ArduinoProjects/tree/master/Nodemcu_Geekcreit/ThingSpeakDataUpload/ThinkgSpeakDataUpload_v014)
- The NodeMCU board is one among the many ESP8266 boards out there but with a bit of a difference.
- This board is highly affordable (costs around 8-10 AUD), connects to a USB port of your machine, is breadboard friendly and most importantly works with the Arduino IDE.
- As part of this program you will connect to the local wireless network, read values from the Soil moisture sensor and tweet the values.
- The code also uses the Thingspeak Arduino library to upload data points to ThingSpeak and view graphically the data being logged. 
- To get this program working you will need the credentials for a local wireless network so that you can connect to it.
- You will need to setup an account at www.thingspeak.com, create a channel and setup it up so that you can write to the channel using your NodeMCU.
- You will then need to head off and setup a Twitter account at www.twitter.com and configure the thingtweet application.
- The thingtweeet application (https://thingspeak.com/apps/thingtweets) requires that you register your Twitter account with Thingspeak.  Here's a summary of the steps involved. Please refer to the details at the Thingspeak website. - 
  - Sign in to https://thingspeak.com/login, select Apps from the menu, and then click on ThingTweet.
  - Under the ThingTweet App, select “Link new Twitter account”. 
  - This will redirect you to Twitter to see if you want the app to have the ability to access your account.
  - You can Allow or Deny the process. Once you have confirmed the right Twitter account, Twitter will send you back to ThingSpeak.
  - The app generates a ThingTweet API Key for you to use. If you send an HTTP POST with your ThingTweet API Key, then the message will be relayed to Twitter. 
  - All of the parameters from the Twitter API (statuses/update) are possible including geolocation.
- Over the coming weeks (or months..as and when i can find time) I will update the code such that it only tweets when certain conditions are met.
- Currently the code tweets every 5 minutes
- Connections for this circuit include -
 - Connecting the NodeMCU board to the USB port of your development machine
 - Software required includes -
   - Arduino IDE
   - ESP8266 libraries packes into the Arduino IDE which include the packages for NodeMCU board

- As part of this program you will connect to the local wireless network, read values from the Soil moisture sensor and tweet the values.
- This version of the Soil Moisture Sensor program also uses the Thingspeak Arduino library to upload data points to ThingSpeak and view graphically the data being logged. 
- In addition the modification includes sending email alerts based on an assessment of how low the moisture in the soil is. This is a configurable value and while I've set this to 100 you can change this to any other value that works for your setup at home.
- To get this program working you will need the credentials for a local wireless network so that you can connect to it.
- You will need to setup an account at www.thingspeak.com, create a channel and setup it up so that you can write to the channel using your NodeMCU.
